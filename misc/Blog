Today I heard back from McGill regarding my graduate program application and I got in! When I got the e-mail telling me there was a significant update on my application I was both upset at why the e-mail couldn't just tell right away whether I was accepted or not and excited. I'm not sure why I was excited and not anxious. I think I knew deep inside that I ould get accepted. After seeing the official acceptance letter, I felt a rush of relief. The weird thing is, I don't even want to do grad school. I lost my motivation to continue my studies soon after I learned I would be graduating from my undergrad program. I think the relief comes from being validated, like I'm good enough to be in McGill's graduate program. People say it's not hard to get in and it's probably true, but it still feels good.
