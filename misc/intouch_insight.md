# InTouch InSight

## About the company:
Provides Customer Experience Management technology solutions. Four products: IntouchShop, IntouchSurvey, IntouchAudit, IntouchCheck.

### IntouchShop
**Mystery shopping** is a tool used to measure quality of service, compliance with regulation, or to gather specific information about products and services.
Consumer's specific identity and purpose are not known by the establishment being evaluated.
A client company would hire an external company providing mystery shoppers and they would agree on a survey model which will define what customer experience aspect the client company would like like to measure.

InTouch InSight has a group of certified mystery shoppers visiting client locations and complete mobile app questionnaires designed to align with the client company's brand standards. Nearly 1 million mystery shoppers.

App flow:
1. Nearby mystery shop alerts
1. Mystery shoppers find, complete and submit questionnaires
1. Real-time, richer data by requiring taking photos
1. Results can be seen as soon as they are submitted

The dashboards can be designed to be role and location specific. Can display real-time list of top issues. Filter data to drill down specific issues.

### IntouchSurvey
Surveys deployed through custom URLs, barcodes, QR codes, email, or text messages.
**Net Promoter Score (NPS)** is a customer loyalty metric. NPS of -100 means everyone is a detractor, +100 means everyone is a promoter. The score is calculated based on a single question: *How likely is it that you would recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague?*
Question types: multiple choice, scaled reponse, text input, date input, product grids, NPS, photos, videos.
Dynamic questions: skip questions, conditional branching, answer piping.
CSS for custom, branded surveys.
Improve response rate with incentives - draws, coupons, gamification, social media engagement, charity donations.
Automatic email notifications to location managers.
JIRA-like issue tracking.

### InTouchCheck
