1. Working at MUHC, working directly with doctors, presenting work and getting feedback from doctors and patients themselves, felt close to home and personal especially because one of our supervisors was a cancer patient. Worked full-stack, MySQL database, python + php backend, AngularJS and OnsenUI front-end. Took on the ML project on my own.
1. Experience working with small teams in previous internships.

### Why do I want to work at Epic?
Knowing that my work directly influences so many people in the States and around the world, knowing our work is important and benefits so many people are huge motivators. At MUHC, the impact of our work on the doctors and patients was greatly emphasized and pushed us to work harder and better, especially because we interacted directly with patients and doctors. I'm looking for that kind of motivation and collaborative working environment where we can learn from each other, which Epic can provide. 
Epic careers website provides a lot of information on things that benefit the employees, like continuous learning, taking courses at University of Wisconsin, things to do at Wisconsin, and company benefits. It really shows the company cares for its employees, which I admire.
