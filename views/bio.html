	First thing you should know about me is I suck at writing so please excuse my bulletpoint format.

	- My name is Nami, like tsunami without the tsu. I got the name from Harvest Moon/One Piece.
	- I recently graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering.
	- I currently have a summer research position at McGill University Health Clinic (MUHC) on waiting time estimates for oncology patients using machine learning methods.
	- I'm also looking for a full-time developer position, so if you'd like to know more about my technical background, here's my CV! Please hire me.
	- I was born in Seoul, South Korea on January 1st, 1994.
	- I like being physically active (or try to). I've been weight training for 6-7 months, some weeks more consistently than others. I've started dragonboating, and I bike between work and school/home.
	- I like games, mostly League of Legends and board games with friends. 
	- I can make fart noises with my ears.
