<!-- A portrait picture of me (waist-up) with some kind of highlighting lines around me slide up to the center of the screen,
	a short biography around my photo appears top to bottom (https://davidwalsh.name/css-slide).

	Hi, my name is Nami. First thing you should know about me is I suck at writing so please excuse my bulletpoint format.

	- My name is Nami, like tsunami without the tsu.
	- I recently graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering.
	- I currently have a summer research position at McGill University Health Clinic (MUHC) on waiting time estimates for oncology patients using machine learning methods.
	- I'm also looking for a full-time developer position, so if you'd like to know more about my technical background, here's my CV! Please hire me.
	- I was born in Seoul, South Korea on January 1st, 1994. It was a tough year, Kurt Cobain dying a few months later and whatnot.
	- Computer Taskforce (CTF) has been my life the last 4 years during my university years. My life wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable without them, and I really mean that.
	- I like being active! I've been weight training for 6-7 months, some weeks more consistently than others. I've started dragon-boating, and I bike between work and school/home.
	- I like games, mostly League of Legends and board games with friends. 
	- I can make fart noises with my ears.
