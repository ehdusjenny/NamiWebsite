#Algonquin Park

For Canada Day, I decided to go camping at Algonquin Park with two of my friends, Tara and David :D

From Montreal, it took 5 hours of driving to get to Algonquin Park (thanks David for driving!).

On the way we passed by cute little communities near the park called Eganville and Barry's Bay, and took a note to explore them on the way back.

Forecast predicted rain on our first and third day at the park, second day being the only really sunny day to fully enjoy the park, which was fine by us. We took it as a challenge to survive in the rain.

Once at the park, we picked up our canoe and tied it to the car and filled out our registration form.

Cost for renting a canoe for two people (plus optional area for third person) came out to be $177 with accessories (life jackets, whistle, rope, bailer), and registration $85 so total ~$90 per person. Not bad!

Our car with the canoe tied:

We started our journey from Cache Lake, to canoe for 1.3 KM:

Look at that ominous sky. Minutes later rain started pouring HARD.

See the raindrops on the water. It got a lot worse once we started canoeing. It felt like we were trying to escape our home in a post-apocalyptic movie.

A little celebration after getting on land!

Here came the hardest part of our journey: portaging (carrying the canoe on your shoulders) for 1.6 KM. Our saviour Tara did the ENTIRE route by herself with few breaks in between, which I'm 100% sure I can't do.
