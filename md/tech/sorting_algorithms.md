### Types of sorting algorithms:
1. **Stable**: In the original list, record *R* appears before record *S* and they both have the same key, *R* will appear before *S* in the sorted list.

## Merge Sort

## Insertion Sort

## Timsort
Timsort is a hybrid stable sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort.
Timsort is Python's standard sorting algorithm.

### Operation
Timsort iterates over the data looking for natural runs (runs of consecutive ordered elements) that are either strictly descending or non-descending. Descending runs are later reversed. Note that any two elements are either strictly descending or non-descending.
