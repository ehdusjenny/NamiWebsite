#HR Tips

Couple job searching tips gathered from HR workshops. This is for technical jobs.

##FOR RESUMES
**K.I.S.S. - Keep It Simple, Stupid!** Unless you are going for design related jobs, keep your resume simple - usually black and white. Colors generally give you no benefit, only distraction. 

Include good **keywords**, like programming languages and software/hardware technologies you've worked with. Some companies have automated filters to look for certain keywords, so make sure you read the job posting carefully and include the same or related keywords.

Keep your resume maximum two pages, ideally **one page**. HRs look for concise and clear resumes that are easy to quickly look over and understand. If [Elon Musk][elonmusk] and [Marissa Mayer][marissamayer] can keep their resumes one page, so can you!

**Expertise level** should be split into at most two - working knowledge and basic knowledge. For working knowledge, list the technologies you have worked and feel comfortable with the most. For basic knowledge, include technologies you have some experience with or have a basic understanding of, but only if they are relevant to the job you are applying. Don't clutter your resume with useless technologies you aren't even comfortable with.

Move hobbies and personal interests to LinkedIn. HRs are looking for job competency. Once they're interested, they'll look at your LinkedIn and then they'll get to see what a hard-working, yet fun-loving person you are!

Lastly, have someone **proofread** your resume, even for just spelling errors. A minor spelling mistake may seem unprofessional and not well-prepared.

##FOR LINKEDIN
This is where you can expand your resume! Show some personality. Upload your **profile picture**!
On top of applying on company websites, reach out to the recruiter directly through LinkedIn. 
After networking, follow up through LinkedIn.

##FOR HR INTERACTION
After you've interacted with the HRs several times, you might be tempted to be more casual and friendly with them. Remind yourself that it is their job to intract with you, and it is **strictly professional**, so be professional at all times.

During the hiring process, make sure to send your HR a quick **thank-you e-mail** at every stage. In one sense, your HR has power over your future and a little thank-you goes a long way.

##FOR INTERVIEWS
Do prepare around 3 questions to ask, about the company, about the workflow of your team, company products, etc. It shows you care, or at least made the effort to pretend you care.
For design or coding questions, ask questions to clarify their instructions. The initial instructions are often intentionally unclear for you to ask the right type of questions. While coding, explain everything you're doing step by step. Don't leave the interviewer waiting.


##FOR TECH FAIRS AND OTHER NETWORKING
Research the job/company thoroughly beforehand, and show that you've researched them. You can never know too much about the company.

Good eye-contact and a firm handshake goes a long way. Make your presence known.

Be a good listener. You do want to sell yourself but at the same time don't be selfish with the talking space.
Everyone is there to network and get to know as many people as possible, so don't hog and keep your conversations maximum **15-20 minutes** per person. 

##MISCELLANEOUS
During your job hunting season, make sure to leave room for voicemail. You don't want to leave the burden of having to call again to the HR, or in the worst case never get a call again. 
Create a voicemail message which includes **your name**. If you miss the HR's call, at least they'll know they called the right number.
