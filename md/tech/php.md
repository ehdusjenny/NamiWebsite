# PHP Basics

PHP is a strictly server-side scripting language.

To get started, you need three components:
1. Web Server - Any web server works, Apache is most commonly used. 
2. Database - Any database works, MySQL is most commonly used.
3. PHP Parser

I'm using Windows, so I will use WAMP, which is a Apache-MySQL-PHP environment set-up for Windows.
