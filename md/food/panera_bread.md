#Panera Bread

I've actually never heard of Panera Bread before visiting this place but apparently it's a big American chain bakery/casual eatery. We don't have these in Montreal so why not try it before we leave Ottawa!

We made a mistake not trying their baked goods. They looked so good; big portions, heaping toppings and delicious, ready to be eaten. Good thing we went on Mother's Day and they gave us complementary pound cake, which was nice!

Unfortunately, we decided to try their savoury meals instead.

We ordered French onion soup in bread bowl, chicken salad, and chicken panini.

The bread bowl was great - fluffy and chewy, went perfect with the soup. We were a little disappointed with the portion given the price.

The salad was solid, nothing much to complain about. You get fresh vegetables and tender chicken.

The panini was good too, but the problem with this place really is the portion given the prices. Each of the dishes were ~$12 and the panini came with just an apple and a bag of chips. Not satisfying at all.

Overall, it was pleasant enough but I would go back only to try the baked goods.
