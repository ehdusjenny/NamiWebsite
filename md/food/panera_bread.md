#Panera Bread

I've actually never heard of Panera Bread before visiting this place but apparently it's a big American chain bakery/casual eatery. We don't have these in Montreal so why not try it before we leave Ottawa!

We made a mistake not trying their baked goods. They looked so good; big portions, heaping toppings and delicious, ready to be eaten.
