#Le Majesthe

Hidden gem Asian fusion Taiwanese place near McGill!

The day we went they had a special sushi/kimbap dish with pork belly and kimchi.

SO GOOD. Pork belly + kimchi + rice combination can't go wrong for me.

For a main meal, I had the butternut squash pasta.

Ahhh look at that beauty *_*. It's soooo creamy! I've never had anything like it at other places and the candied bacon is a good compliment to the creaminess.

My friend had the pork floss rice bowl minus the poached egg. I've had it last time I visited and it was good, but not as good as the pasta in my opinion.

9.5/10!
