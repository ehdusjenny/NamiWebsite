#Nouilles de Lanzhou

This is the restaurant above G&D Market in Chinatown with the live display of a worker making the noodles fresh right in front of you. It certainly attracts tourists but the place is good to frequent even for locals.

We got the cucumber salad for appetizer. I really like the peanut crumbles sprinkled on top. The cucumber tasted refreshing and spicy, it reminded me of cucumber kimchi. They use a lot of the Szechuan peppers so it's a bit numbing.

We ordered the noodles with braised beef tendon and Zhajiang. I especially liked the Zhajiang, which was cold noodles. I really liked the black bean sauce and the tea egg was as good as usual. I think I would've wanted more of the sauce compared to the noodle portion they gave us.

The braised beef tendon was super tender and soup was heart-warming. 

It's cool that you can choose the size of your noodles here, from round thin noodles to thick flat noodles. I always go with the thinnest round ones, I found they have the best chewy texture.

Everything was not super amazing but definitely above average and I'd come back again.
