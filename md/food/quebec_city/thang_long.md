#Thang Long

For the dinner of our Quebec Day Trip, we tried out a Vietnamese restaurant. 

We tried the Hue noodles with vermicelli and beef, Thailandaise with chicken, and General Tao chicken, shown in that respective order.

So the beef in the Hue was too tough and cut too thick so it was difficult to eat. I really liked the soup though! It warmed me up in the chilly evening. The portion was just okay, the bowl was mostly filled with soup but not enough noodles which is a rare case since every Vietnamese place I've been to previously gave me way more than enough. 

The General Tao chicken was really tough too, unfortunately. It tasted like it was fried way too many times and the overwhelmingly sweet sauce didn't help alleviate that.

One tiny complaint is I asked for no cilantro in my soup, when he arrived with the order, I asked him whether there's cilantro, he said "no" with a stammer, and voila there's cilantro (I know, I know, why go to a Vietnamese place if you don't like cilantro, I wonder as well). If it was proper service, he would've taken the soup back and have the kitchen take the cilantro out or at least make the effort to, at the least not lie about it. 

However, considering the terrible reputation of Quebec City food, Thang Long was relatively decent. But I think that just shows Quebec City food suuuuucks.

Overall 6/10.
