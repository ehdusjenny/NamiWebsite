#Presotea

Mango lovers everywhere, here's THE place to satisfy your cravings! I wish Montreal had bubble tea places with fresh fruits like this place, or if there is one, please let me know.

The interior is a narrow, long hallway with some tables at the back.

It looks like they also sell their drinks in light bulb shaped cups, but they looked uncomfortable to use. I guess you'd only get them for aesthetics but we wanted to enjoy our bubble tea so we didn't get one :P.

We got a mango slushie with fresh mangos and black and white pearls and mango slushie with basil seeds. The mangos tasted fresh and the slushie was refreshing, perfect for a summer day. It was super filling too, I guess the only problem being you can't finish this as a dessert after a meal :P. I'm craving this right now actually, as I write this 100 miles away from Ottawa.

The service was good. We got the right orders in a timely manner, nothing to complain!

Overall, 10/10!
