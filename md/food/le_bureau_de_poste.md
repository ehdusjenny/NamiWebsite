#Le Bureau de Poste

During our day long Quebec City trip, we visited a bar where everything on the menu is $4.95. A family friend recommended this place to us so we had somewhat of a high expectation.

I ordered a homemade peach iced tea:

It tasted like melted candy. It tasted like they used peach juice from can, I still liked it nonetheless being a sweet tooth :P

The onion rings had a sweet glaze over it, with a side of aioli mayo. It was average, it tasted like frozen onion rings out of the box.
We chose lemon & salt flavoring for the wings, but it just tasted salty. The wings were dry and old. Do not recommend :/. We also got a side of carrots and celery for a dollar extra but turned out to not be worth it as you can see in the picture.

Their perogies were the only saving grace. The crispy bacon and the green onions were a good compliment to the cheesy fillings.

The dip was super rich, warm and creamy. The nachos were meh, the bread was good.

We got some beet and goat cheese salad. It was simple but good. Portion was pretty small for $5 though.

![Potato](../images/food/quebec_city/le_bureau_de_poste/12.jpg "Potato")

The potato skin had wayyy too much of the potato, it turned out to be more like bland baked potatoes instead of being crispy. The braised beef was good, but we left most of the potato uneaten.

![Spaghetti](../images/food/quebec_city/le_bureau_de_poste/15.jpg "Spaghetti")

So the biggest shock I've ever gotten at a restaurant was this spaghetti 'cause it was just laughably bad. It tasted like spaghetti from a can. Noodles were way overcooked and the sauce was tasteless. Braised beef was just okay, definitely not good enough to salvage everything else that's atrociously bad. The plate came out like the picture, with a really sloppy presentation.

The burger used frozen store bought patty, it tasted like nothing. Worse than that were the buns. It was the furthest thing from fluffy and made everything else taste worse. The yam fries were good though, but if you can't do fries right you shouldn't open a restaurant.

The only thing we recommend from this place is the coffee.

Overall 2/10, only points coming from perogies :<.
