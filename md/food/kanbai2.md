#Kanbai - Second Visit

So we went back to Kanbai when my aunt visited us since she liked it last time we went.

We ordered double fried pork with szechuan style sauce, chicken with chinese mushrooms, shrimp with hot chili sauce, beef chow fun with black bean sauce, and fried rice with shrimp.

Chicken and beef were super, duper tender. Shrimp was good too, although I wasn't too fond of eating it with the shell. Chow fun was overcooked, trying to use chopsticks would instantly break the noodles. 

Overall everything was pretty salty. 

I think we ordered too much sauteed dishes, I was getting pretty sick of it by the end. Maybe some kind of stew/soup or fried dish would've added to the variety.

Overall 7/10.
