# Cafe Tommy

Came here with a friend for one of our cafe hunting (hi Seasy). Located at the edge of Old Montreal, it's a small, picturesque place.

They had a good assortment of sweets. I tried their matcha latte, brioche, and Nutella cronut.

The pastries seem to be store-bought, at least the brioche is as I've seen the exact same thing at another place. Regardless it was good, same for the cronut. Matcha latte was good too, I'd order it again! They make it fresh with matcha powder on the spot. 

Their prices are definitely not cheap, but affordable for occasional outings.

Super cute, cozy comfortable environment, friendly service.

Overall 8.5/10!
