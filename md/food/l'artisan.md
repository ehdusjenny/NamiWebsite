#L'Artisan

Ahhh this place is too good to be true! This small pastry shop next to my hair salon is a hidden gem. Everything we got here were top quality and quite cheap actually. We got 4 things and total came to be around $15, which is pretty good.

![Eclair](../images/food/montreal/lartisan/20.jpg "Eclair")

First picture is some kind of almond bread, the inside was super moist and soft. Second picture is some kind of almond-chocolatey tart thingy, SO GOOD. The eclair was good too but the best thing about it was the maple topping ahhh.

Overall a big 10/10!
