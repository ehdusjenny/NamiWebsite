#C'ChoColat

I looooove their Belgian waffles! It's so overwhelmingly sweet but perfect for satisfying my sweet tooth :).

Last time we got the Rocky Mountain Waffle, which is topped with brownies, marshmallow, bananas, cashews, Fleur du sel caramel, and dark chocolate.
Everything mixes so well together, for every bite try to incorporate all the components. I'm craving it as I'm writing this haha. The Fleur du sel caramel stood out for us, we basically licked the plates clean for it.

Another group got the must-try half-chocolate-dome C'Wow, which comes with a dark chocolate dome filled with waffles, brownie, gelato, crumbles, berries, and pecan. The waiter will pour the caramel over the dome to melt the dome and reveal the inside, but you could ask to pour the caramel yourself to control the portion. I find when the waiters themselves pour it the caramel is too much and the sweetness becomes way too overwhelming (who knew that was possible?). 
It's also a lot more fun to pour it yourself!

Overall a great experience!
