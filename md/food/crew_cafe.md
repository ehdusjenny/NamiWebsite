#Crew & Collective Cafe

I looked up the closest cafe when visiting Chinatown and discovered this unique cafe nearby, in Old Montreal.

The location used to be Royal Bank, built in 1926. It's recently been (2-3 years ago) transformed into a cafe targeted for freelance and start-up workers.

Inside is gorgeous. You can see in the first picture below the row of glass panes that were used by bank tellers.

You can also see at the far end reserved semi-private working spaces. 

You can become a member for reserved working spaces, but it's a tad bit expensive:

There are also an array of souvenirs and baked goods:

The ceiling had very intricate and stunning engravings.

Okay, now to the most important part: FOOD!

I had an iced latte, mini donut and bread pudding.

The mini dark chocolate donut had roasted marshmellows on top with graham cracker crumbs. Small, but super rich, enough to satisfy your sweet craving :)

Bread pudding was made with brioche bread, with walnuts, coconut shavings, dark chocolate pieces, some peppery spices, and raisins, dipped in some syrup. I'm sure I missed other ingredients but that's all my unsophisticated taste buds could figure out :'). Was good, not overly sweet.

Iced latte was good, my favourite out of all other iced lattes I've tried actually. 

I think everything came to ~$14? Latte was around $4.5, mini donut $3.5, bread pudding $4.5. It's definitely not cheap but everything tasted really good!

I came back later to show my mom and my auntie this place and tried their chocolate and marshmellow cookie and affogato.

Both super tasty, their espresso is also the best I've had so far. Auntie confirms they make good espresso, and she knows her coffee.

Overall 9/10, only losing points on their prices.
