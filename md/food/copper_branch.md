#Copper Branch

100% vegetarian place near McGill! I wish I knew about this place while I was a student.

They have really great salads called Power Bowls. My favourite Power Bowl so far is the Mediterranio with sun dried tomatoes, green peppers, chia seeds, eggplant, zucchini, sweet potato, chickpeas, broccoli, beets, mung beans, and carrot on a bed of lettuce. For protein we chose smoked tofu cubes which was amazing. I love literally every single thing they include. Sadly, I don't have a picture of it :(.

We went another time and ordered Aristotle, which includes sweet potato, spinach hummus, bruschetta, black olives, hemp seeds, broccoli, beets, carrots, chickpeas, mung beans on top of noodles. For protein, we chose carrot keftedes, which were like falafels but with carrots. This was good too, but I'd rather order Mediterranio when I go back.

We also ordered two burgers: Mushroom Galaxy Burger and Spicy Black Bean Burger. The mushroom one is a giant chewy, juicy, flavorful portobello mushroom with eggplant, caramelized onions, "cheese", lettuce and aioli sauce. Black bean burger was with a patty made of black beans, sweet potato, rice, and few other ingredients. The food itself is really, really good and if I were a vegetarian I'd want to eat this everyday. However, the prices are bit steep. With tax it comes to around $10 for just a burger. Maybe not worth the money to try more than once, at least for me.

Next time I really want to try their wings, I'm curious what vegetarian-style wings would taste like.

The first time I came by, the service was really nice. The cashier was very friendly and made small talk about Harry Potter :). The workers always seem to have smiles on their faces. Good atmosphere.
