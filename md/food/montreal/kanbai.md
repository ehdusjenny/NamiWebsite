#Kanbai - First Visit

Okay, it's not actually my first, but it's my first documented visit. We can pretend the previous ones never existed.

I came here with my mom.

We ordered Kung Pow Shrimps, chicken fried rice, beef satay, shrimp wonton soup and sweet and sour soup.

Shrimp was good, although the peanuts would've went better with Kung Pow chicken. Also the sauce was a tad bit too sweet. Fried rice was good, standard dish. Beef satay was good, but the meat was unnaturally tender, maybe using too much baking soda to tenderize it.

I really liked their wontons, it was packed with shrimp patties and was actually filling unlike measly wontons you usually get at other Chinese places. Sweet and sour soup was good too, although I'm not a huge fan of them in general.

Food also came out super fast even though it seemed fairly busy. And the waitress was really nice!

Overall 9/10.
