#La Banquise

Good ol' La Banquise, I'll never get tired of you :)

I have a soft spot for poutine 'cause I love them and I'm fat. Of all the places I've tried in Montreal La Banquise remains my favourite place for poutine. Their portions are huge and their variety doesn't get old.

I ordered the Southwest, it's actually the best thing I've ordered from here by far. There were loads of onion rings and guacamole, and I looove both of them. Chipotle sauce added a kick of flavour on top of all the fattiness.

My friends ordered La Chicks, La Savoyarde, and La Veganomane. In that order:

I'd recommend La Chicks if you have a particular craving for breaded chicken, but it doesn't offer more than that. The Savoyarde was also really good, but TBH I mostly only remember stealing the sour cream to add to my poutine :^).
I think I tried a bit of the vegetarian poutine but I don't really remember much about it, sorry vegetarian readers :(.

Honestly there's nothing I can complain about this place so overall 10/10!
