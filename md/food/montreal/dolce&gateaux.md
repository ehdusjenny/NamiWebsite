#Dolce & Gateaux

Before heading out to our Algonquin Park camping trip, we stopped by a super cute cupcake place next to my friend's place, called Dolce & Gateaux.

Featuring my friend ducking out of the way :-)

They had a lot of sweets on display everywhere and I tried to run around taking pictures of them without being too obnoxious:

My friend recommended getting cupcakes over other things so we were tasked with the challenge of choosing three out of all the delicious looking choices:

We ended up getting Chocolate & salted caramel, Black Forest, and Mango with Passionfruit. I didn't get to try their Black Forest but the salted caramel and chocolate was a-ma-zing. Mango and passionfruit was interesting, the flavour was very mild until you get to the jam in the center. 
I'll come back to try the other flavours for sure!

Overall 10/10!!
