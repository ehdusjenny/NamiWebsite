#Momesso

We went to this sub place that many claim to be the best in Montreal after our dragon boat practice. It's a 5 minute walk from Station Vendome, close to the Lachine Canal.

We ordered the supreme 7", steak 14", and large onion rings to share. Total came out to be around $32, which is pretty good considering the 14" portion is big enough to be shared between two. 

The supreme sub came with sausages, steak, peppers, tomato, lettuce, onions, mushrooms, cheese and spicy sauce. Their spicy sauce is soooo good, it really ups the flavour meter. Everything was super flavourful and it all blended well together.

The onion rings didn't taste homemade but it was still good. The large one can be shared between 2, maybe even 3.

Service was very friendly, including the cook in the front kitchen taking the order.

All in all it was a very filling meal for a very reasonable price.

9/10!
