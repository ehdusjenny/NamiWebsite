#La Cabane de Danny

A pretty new Bubble Waffle place opened up at Chinatown. I've never had one so of course I had to try it! You get freshly made bubble waffle, two scoops of ice cream, and 3 other toppings. We got green tea and black sesame ice cream, m&ms, red bean paste and pocky. They made a mistake with the topping and we got extra sprinkles :^).

Waffle was really good, the bubbles are super cake-y and dense, outside was crispy. It's a very filling treat. With tax everything came to about $10 so you wouldn't have this often.

Solid 9/10!
