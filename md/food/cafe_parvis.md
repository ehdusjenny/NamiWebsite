# Cafe Parvis

I decided to try Cafe Parvis on a whim after looking at their good reviews online. I was looking for a small coffee and pastry break, but after looking at their nice pizza menu I decided to venture a meal.

Their prices are a bit on the high side, considering their portion size. Regardless they have a creative menu. 

I ordered the pizza with bechamel sauce, bacon, endive, gruyere, pear and hazelnuts.

It was really good! Their pizza bread was like crunchy flatbread, I liked it a lot better than regular rising pizza dough. I'd eat the bread on its own and enjoy it almost as much as the pizza.

The mix of nuttiness from the toasted hazelnut, saltiness from the crispy bacon, and the sweetness from the pear and the caramelized endives was suuuper nice. 

None of the toppings were overwhelming and everything blended nicely.

My only complaint is that the portions were too small compared to its price, I felt they were too sparing with the toppings. Either go a bit more ham with the toppings or lower the prices by a few dollars.

The people and the place were really nice, with plants and terrace at the front and the inside felt really cozy. Unfortunately, I think I chose a particularly bad seating that faced a wall covered in candle wax.

Maybe this is an aesthetic some might like but it just seemed dirty and unappetizing to me. 

Overall 8.5/10!
